# CAESAR_CIPHER


Caesar Cipher Python
Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Python project! This project implements the classic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm using Python. It includes functions for encryption, decryption, and enhancing user experience.

Introduction
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. This project provides a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher with added features to enhance user experience.

Features
Encryption: Encrypts plaintext by shifting characters.
Decryption: Decrypts ciphertext to retrieve the original plaintext.
Customizable Shift: Allows users to specify the shift value for encryption and decryption.
User-friendly Interface: Interactive functions to input text and shift values.
Installation
To use this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The project does not have any external dependencies.

Usage
You can use the provided functions to encrypt and decrypt messages.
